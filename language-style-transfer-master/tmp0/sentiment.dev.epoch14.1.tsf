and i had my boyfriend and there and my other group of time !
disappointing !
this place is ridiculous .
other sesame hot cream tomatoes and the chicken cream is like the problem .
quality ice cream in a very disappointing experience again .
i have only had the chicken chicken , but it was n't the worst !
they have a lot of fish items and the servers were very friendly .
the wait was a little good , but it was not worth it !
great fact i 've felt like it has to try that they walked away .
in a horrible way .
the was the , for cooked some .
not go for the lack of cheese .
the food is ok , but the hot of fries are cold sauce !
there is a huge selection of over old and dried and .
not do i know these , they never up to the house .
we only get back and were very disappointed to finish .
we sat at the bar on in friday and had a bad time .
my biggest complaint was _num_ % .
i got the other steak instead .
not worth the drive !
food and cheese are so very unprofessional !
a little , `` `` money '' .
poor service and so a disappointing or me from your home .
a must have in in your neighborhood restaurants !
that is in my ice cream cream .
no excuse to .
the lack of staff and a bad experience in $ my opinion .

, flat disappointment .
i 've had to eat their food and the hot cream was okay .
prices are horrible .
staff is terrible !
nothing for a small restaurant and i wo n't return to it .
maybe i ordered the most more than my ice cream chicken .
there is a shame thing for me and me on them for your other .

i ca n't know how their hype is so annoying .
and it 's very reasonably of priced .
it 's an old fried chicken cream there were the hot and had tasteless .
we really hate the other time for all .
disgusting !
